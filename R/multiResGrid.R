#' Create multi-resolution grids based on confidentiality or reliability restrictions
#' 
#' Function that creates a multi-resolution grid with larger grid cells in
#' regions with lower resolution of data, or where data needs to
#' be anonymized for disclosure control reasons. The function can also be used
#' to create a grid of new variables, using an existing multi-resolution grid 
#' as template.
#' The possible restrictions that will lead to aggregation of a grid cell are:
#' \enumerate{
#'  \item{ Frequency rule (Aggregate to reach a minimum number of counts)}
#'  \item{ Dominance rule (Aggregate because of dominance by one or more units)}
#'  \item{ p-percent rule (Aggregate because the second largest producer could identify the production
#'         of the largest producer with less than p percent uncertainty. )}
#'  \item{ Reliability rule (Aggregate because the uncertainty is too high)}
#'  \item{ User defined rule (Aggregate because a grid cell does not respect a user defined criteria)}
#' }

#' @details This function will find the highest resolution data set that fulfills the 
#'        confidentiality rules and potential reliability rules for variable(s) of interest.
#'        Starting with the second highest resolution (5 km in the default settings),
#'        the function will check if any of the 1 km sub pixels will have values not fulfilling
#'        any of the confidentiality rules (number of farms, values of the 2 largest compared to values of the 
#'        entire grid cell).
#'        If all values are above the confidentiality limits, the grid cells will be kept at a 1 km resolution,
#'        otherwise only the 5 km grid cell will be kept. This will again be tested against the confidentiality
#'        rules in the next iteration, when grid cells will possibly be merged to 10 km grid cells.
#'
#'        The function can also be called if it is necessary to create a grid of a new variable for the same
#'        grid as an already existing variable. The confidentiality rules will then be applied to the new
#'        variables for the existing grid cells, and mask the ones that do not respect the rules.
#'        The function will not do any further merging
#'        of grid cells, for this it is necessary to grid the variables together.
#'        This feature is useful when the new data set has a similar resolution 
#'        as the original data set. It will give a high number of missing values if
#'        the resolution of the new data is more sparse than the original. In the examples below,
#'        this means that it is possible to copy the grid of organic organic 
#'        agricultural area to a grid of all agricultural area, whereas the opposite
#'        will not work well.
#'
#'        The standard threshold rule for spatial data is at least 10 units (mincount). 
#'        
#'        The parameters nlarge and plim are used for determining the dominance treatment for the variable of interest,
#'        with default values of \code{nlarge = 2} and \code{plim = 0.85}. 
#'        If more than plim of the values of the grid cell (e.g. UAA, arable land, number of livestock)
#'        is explained by 1-nlarge weighted holdings, the grid cell will not pass the confidentiality rule.
#'        
#'        It is also possible to apply the p-percent rule. This rule defines a minimum percentage for how close the 
#'        second largest producer could be of estimating the production of the largest producer by subtracting
#'        its own production from the total value of the cell. 
#'        \deqn{(Y_{cell}-Y_2-Y_1)/Y_1 < pPercent} 
#'        where \eqn{Y_{cell}, Y_2, Y_1} represent the total production value of the cell,
#'        the value of the second largest production, and the value of the largest production,
#'        respectively.
#'        
#'        The concept of reliability is explained in details in section 4.6 in the integrated farm survey handbook for 2023:
#'        https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/IFS/Integrated+Farm+Statistics+Manual+%7C+2023+edition
#'        In short, it is an estimate of the coefficient of variation for an estimate (a grid cell in this case),
#'        based on the number in the sample relative to the number in the population, and taking into account
#'        possible stratified sampling approaches. The number is zero if all holdings in the population in 
#'        a grid cell has been sampled, and the default requirement is that the CV is less than 35%.
#'        
#'        The computation can be time and memory intensive, particularly for the first iteration. 
#'        The method involves creation (and inversion) of a matrix of
#'        size \code{nr*ng}, where \code{nr} is the number of records and \code{ng} is the number of grid cells.
#'        it is therefore sometimes necessary to split the data set into smaller parts, to reduce
#'        the computational challenges. The parameter \code{reliabilitySplit} is used for this. 
#'        It will split the area of interest into several subsets. This will have some impact
#'        on the reliability calculations. The \code{reliabilitySplit} value might be set temporarily
#'        higher for the first iterations, as it will also depend on the number of grid cells.
#'        
#'        Reliability cannot be calculated for records belonging to strata with only one record.
#'        The function will therefore attempt to merge these into pseudostrata, if there is more than one 
#'        of these strata. The \code{pseudoreg}-parameter can be used
#'        to define the regions within which the pseudostrata are created (for example NUTS2-region).
#'        If there are still strata with only one record, these will cause a printed warning.
#'        
#'        
#'        There are some cases where aggregation might not be desired. In the situation where a 
#'        relatively large single grid cell does not respect the confidentiality rules, it is fine to 
#'        aggregate it if the neighbouring grid cells are also relatively large. However, it can be seen
#'        as unfortunate if the single cell was aggregated with many smaller grid cells that could otherwise 
#'        be disseminated at a high resolution. The added value of being able to present a value for a 
#'        region with very few farms is perhaps lower than what is lost by having to aggregate to a 
#'        lower resolution. The parameter \code{suppresslim} indicates the minimum value in a grid cell 
#'        relative to the possible lower resolution grid cell 
#'        before it is necessary to aggregate. If the limit is 0.05, a grid cell would only cause an aggregation
#'        to lower resolution if the value in the grid cell is more than 5\% of the value in the lower resolution 
#'        grid cell. Instead, it would be left as it is, and will be suppressed in the post-processing step.
#'
#'        There are cases when the built-in confidentiality checks are not what the user needs. 
#'        That is why it is possible to submit a user defined function. This function needs to follow
#'        certain rules. 
#'        \enumerate{
#'          \item The first argument must be a data.frame with name \code{df}. 
#'                This is a data.frame with the individual records
#'                for a particular grid cell. It has three columns: 
#'              \enumerate{
#'                 \item himgid - the ID of the current grid cell. This is the grouping variable
#'                        and is constant for the data.frame
#'                 \item gridvar - a new common name for the current variable to be gridded
#'                 \item weight - the weight of the variable to be gridded
#'              }  
#'          \item The function can include additional parameters for calculation of confidentiality
#'                 (or reliability, or suitability, if the meaning of the function refers to something else).
#'                 This can be new parameters to this particular function (through the 
#'                 ellipsis argument (...) of \code{multiResGrid}), existing parameters to \code{multiResGrid},
#'                 or potentially internal variables of \code{multiResGrid.})
#'          \item The result of the function must be a logical, either the rule was passed 
#'                for the records of this grid cell, or not (TRUE/FALSE)
#'          \item The function can potentially use all internal variables in the internal function \code{confid}. 
#'                Only the most useful will be mentioned here, meaning of the rest will have to be understood from the code.
#'                
#'          
#'        }
#'        A simple example of a \code{userfun} is given in the example section below (the one producing \code{himg6})
#'        
#'
#'
#' @returns The function will return a multi-resolution grid with observations
#' gridded to different grid cell sizes according to the confidentiality rules
#' to be applied. It can also include some additional columns that indicates 
#' which of the different confidentiality rules that have been applied.
#' 
#' Note that the function might (if \code{postProcess = FALSE})
#' return values also for the confidential grid-cells. This is for the 
#' case where the owner of the data wants to examine data that 
#' will be suppressed during post-processing.
