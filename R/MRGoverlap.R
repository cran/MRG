#' Function that finds and merges overlapping grid cells in a multi-resolution grid
#' The need for this function comes from an error in the gridding process, 
#' and it can be seen as symptom solving rather than solving the issue. 
#' This function will either just show the problematic grid cells or remove the overlaps.

#' @details
#' A multi-resoluion grids should not have overlapping grid cells, by definition.  
#' However, this could happen through stitching different grids together. 
#' Although this should rather have been taken care of during the gridding
#' process, this is not always possible to redo for an end-user. 
#' 
#' This function can first of all be used to identify and show the 
#' overlapping grid cells. It can also be used to create a valid multi-resolution grid for these cases,
#' as long as the grd cells all have the same base grid (i.e. no overlapping grid cells are 
#' partly overlapping, whether the grid cells have the same size or not). 
#' However, there will be some additional errors introduced in this process. 
#' 
#' Except for \code{action = "none"} and \code{action = "replace"}, the function will 
#' try to create a valid grid based on the values in the grid. 
#' This means that it has to find a sensible value for the merged grid cells.
#' Frequently one of the grid cells will have an NA value, meaning that it has been 
#' suppressed. This means that there are observations in the grid cell, but relatively
#' few. If the overlapping grid cell has a value, this is most likely larger, it is
#' non-confidential. The default action is therefore to sum values, but ignore NA-values
#' unless both are NA or one is NA and the other is 0. The last case means that
#' one of the grid cells have a confidential number of records, whereas the 
#' other one has zero records. The total is then a confidential number of records.
#' 
#' if \code{action = "restart"}, there must be a second grid which includes the updated values of 
#' the overlapping grid cells. This could typically happen if the data set is too large
#' to be processed as a single batch. There could then be overlapping grid cells on the border 
#' between different batches. Instead of reprocessing the entire grid, it is possible to
#' reprocess the border regions (in one more more batches, as long as they are not overlapping).
#' The grid cells from the border regions have to be passed as \code{himg2}.
#' 
#' The function uses \code{\link[sf]{st_join}} to check for overlaps. If the grid has
#' a very high number of grid cells (a few tens of thousands), this process can be 
#' rather slow. In that case, it might be better to check parts of the grid separately.
#' 
#' @returns
#' The function will return different objects, depending on "action". The returned object will
#' for different values of "action" be:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{none}{An \code{\link[sf]{sf}} data.frame with the overlapping grid cells}
#'   \item{sum}{A multi-resolution grid containing the sum the values of the overlapping grid cells.
#'      NAs are ignored unless both cells are NA or one is NA and one is 0}
#'   \item{sumna}{A multi-resolution grid containing the sum the values of the overlapping grid cells.
#'        The sum will be NA if any of them is NA}
#'   \item{avg}{A multi-resolution grid containing the average of the grid cells.
#'      NAs are ignored unless both cells are NA or one is NA and one is 0}
#'   \item{avgna}{A multi-resolution grid containing the average of the grid cells.
#'        The average will be NA if any of them is NA}
#'   \item{replace}{A multi-resolution grid containing, where the problematic grid cells
#'        area replaced with grid cells from \code{himg2}}
